## Hi ðŸ‘‹, 

I am a software developer, passionate about ambient computing and voice technologies.

During the day I work at as software developer Gamesys, when the sun goes down I wear the cape of Google Developer Expert for the Google Assistant.

I am a Women Techmakers ambassador and a community lead at [GDG Cloud London](http://gdgcloud.com).

You can speak to me in Portuguese, English, Italian and a little Japanese.
